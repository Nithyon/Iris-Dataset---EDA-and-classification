Iris Dataset Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates data exploration, visualization, and classification using the famous Iris dataset. The focus is on using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify different species of Iris flowers.

Features:

Data Exploration: Visualizing the Iris dataset, including Sepal and Petal dimensions.
SVM Implementation: Training an SVM classifier to predict the species of Iris flowers.
Decision Boundaries: Plotting decision regions for the trained model to visualize classification performance.
Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy and decision boundaries are analyzed.
Libraries Used:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
